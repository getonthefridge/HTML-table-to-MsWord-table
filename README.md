The problem:
Today's learning management systems have found ways to prevent students from copying the text on their websites.
As a student & perfectionist who takes digital notes, I like to include tables in my notes but a screenshot of the table would look ugly and lacks customization

I wrote this program to convert HTML table data into plain text that can easily be converted back into a table in Microsoft Word where it can be fully customized

The solution:
1. Select any text within the table
2. Right click > inspect element
3. Scroll up until you see <table> in the html elements
4. Right click > copy html
5. Paste into the program
6. Paste the output into microsoft word
7. With the text selected, go to Insert > Table > Convert Text to Table

In the future, I would like to get this to work as a browser extension
